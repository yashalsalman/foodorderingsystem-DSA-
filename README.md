This project is part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) coursework and demonstrates the use of linked lists in a real-world scenario.
It is a console-based Food Ordering System developed in Java, where both menu items and customer orders are stored and managed dynamically using custom singly linked list implementations.

The system allows a user to view a menu, place orders, provide personal and payment details, and review a complete order summary. It was built to reinforce my understanding of data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and input handling in Java while creating a functional and interactive application.

Features:
1. ðŸ“œ Dynamic Menu Management â€“ Menu stored in a linked list for easy expansion.
2. ðŸ›’ Order Placement â€“ Add multiple items until the customer is done.
3. ðŸ‘¤ Customer Details â€“ Captures name, contact number, address, and payment method.
4. ðŸ’³ Payment Handling â€“ Supports Cash (adds fixed delivery charges) and Credit Card (stores card number).
5. ðŸ“¦ Order Summary â€“ Displays user details, ordered items, delivery charges (if applicable), and total cost.
6. âš™ Custom Data Structure â€“ Implements linked lists for both menu and order storage instead of using built-in collections.

Technologies & Concepts Used:
1. Language: Java
2. Data Structures: Singly Linked List (custom implementation)

Core Concepts:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Dynamic Node Creation & Traversal
3. Conditional Logic & Control Flow
4. User Input Handling (Scanner)

Skills Developed: Problem-Solving, DSA Implementation, Console-Based Application Design

Future Enhancements:
1. Adding GUI for more smooth design
2. Add search and filter functionality for menu items.
3. Apply sorting (price, alphabetical order) using DSA algorithms.
4. Include discount codes and promotional offers.
